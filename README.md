App requires 2 files in project folder - "dict.txt" with dictionary of collection and "index.txt" - inverted index of the collection.
The output files are: "compressedD.txt" - dictionary compressed using front coding, "compressedI.txt" - inverted index in gamma coding
"dictPointers.txt" - pointers to beginning of each block in front coding file  "indexPointers.txt" = pointers to beginning of gamma code for each word, "decoded.txt" - decoded dictionary, "decompressedI.txt" - decoded index
